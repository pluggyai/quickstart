# React Native Pluggy Connect Example

This an example app that showcases the usage of the Pluggy Connect widget with React Native.

## Setup

Install dependencies:

```
yarn
```

## Run it

### Start Metro

First, run:

```shell
yarn start
```

This will start Metro, the JavaScript bundler that ships with React Native. Metro "takes in an entry
file and various options, and returns a single JavaScript file that includes all your code and its
dependencies."â€”Metro Docs

### Start the application

On a new terminal, run one of the following commands to launch the application, based on your device
OS.

#### Android

```shell
yarn android
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in your Android emulator (
installed with Android Studio) shortly.

#### iOS

Note: this requires an iOS device, and/or macOS for access to an iOS emulator.

```shell
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the iOS emulator shortly.
